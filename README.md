This is a simple project using the 2024 Advent of code to refresh myself when it comes to programing.

To use the code to solve the advant of code, in the Avent2024-main.cpp, Call the funcation for the problem you want to solve.

For instance if you want to solve Day 2 Part 1, you call Day2Part1(); These are Void funcations and no input as the inout from the puzzle files.
